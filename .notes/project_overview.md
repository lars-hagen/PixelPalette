# PixelPalette Overview

## Goal
Build a web application that allows users to generate AI-driven art from text prompts using OpenAI’s DALL-E API. The app will provide an interactive, responsive gallery of AI-generated images, enabling users to download their creations. 

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: **SvelteKit** (modern framework for building fast, reactive web applications).
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS framework for clean and responsive design).
- **Backend (optional)**: **Flask** (used to interact with the OpenAI API and serve the app locally).
- **Dependency Management**: **Poetry** (for managing Python dependencies).

## Key Features
- **Text-to-image generation** powered by OpenAI’s DALL-E API.
- **Dynamic, interactive gallery** displaying generated images.
- **Palette customization options** for users to modify generated artwork styles (color tones, themes).
- **Local hosting** with minimal backend complexity.
